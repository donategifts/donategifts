              The DonateGifts project enables users to donate holiday/ birthday gifts and school supplies to children in
              foster care and orphanages. Donation is directly linked to the product sold on Amazon, and the child's
              wish item will be added to the donor's Amazon cart. With one button click, it will automatically send the
              child's wish item to their address.
            </p>
            <p class="subtext text-left quick-font">
              What's more? Unlike other donation programs and toy drives, our foster child can wish for a specific gift,
              such as a basketball or new shoes, rather than having random gifts delivered to them. Children will
              receive the exact gifts they wished for, and people will have an easier way to get engaged with the
              community.

              Often, the donation process is more complicated than expected. We want to simplify your donation
              experience. With DonateGifts, all you have to do is click one button, which will automatically add the
              child's wish item to your Amazon cart and deliver to the foster child's anonymous address.

            <p class="subtext text-left quick-font hide">
              No need to visit the store to buy gifts and drive down to the drop-off site. No more unnecessary hassle
              for doing good. Now, how simple is that?
