I started this Non-Profit Foundation in honor of my 8 year old son Isaiah who passed away in 2007.  My best friend Freddy past away in 2012.  To keep their memories and spirits alive, I coordinate several community events BLESSING families in need.  One of our goals is to enhance efforts to close the achievement gap by helping children gain access to an array of support for their social emotional, physical, and/or cognitive development.  The Families we work with is made up of a population living below the poverty threshold, which means all of\nour students qualify for free school lunch under the School Nutrition Program (SNP). Our\nfamilies face an array of daily adversities and life challenges. These include things like foster\ncare, homelessness, childhood trauma, broken home families, documentation status issues, and recent migration to the country; these are just to name a few. These challenges result in a variety of needs, including basic needs, for the students and families we work with.\n\nAnother one of our goals is to ensure that more families are served and not overlooked\nthroughout the remainder of the school year; not only during the holiday season.\nPlease be part of the change in the lives of our students. It is confounding how much a generous act of kindness can impact a childâ€™s life. Working together, we can make a difference in the quality of life in our the children we work with. From our community to you and yours, we thank you for your consideration in this request.\n\nWith great appreciation,\n\nJaime Urbina\nFounder",
