                    button.accordion-button( type='button' data-bs-toggle='collapse' data-bs-target='#collapseOne' aria-expanded='true' aria-controls='collapseOne' ) Is my organization required to make a wish card for each and every child or is there a way I can do one big wish card with all of the children that we manage?
                #collapseOne.collapse.show( data-parent='#accordionExample' )
                    .accordion-body Unfortunately, we don't support the bulk creation feature yet.

                    button.accordion-button.collapsed( type='button' data-bs-toggle='collapse' data-bs-target='#collapseThree' aria-expanded='false' aria-controls='collapseThree' ) How do I get started? Our agency is interested in becoming a partner.

                        span The first step that's required of you is to register your agency on our website:
                        a.mx-1( href='/' ) https://donate-gifts.com.
                        span It will ask you to sign up as a foster care partner and there's a simple form with just 4 fields that need to be filled out for verification. Once that's done, we will review and verify your agency account &amp; you can start listing the kids' wishes right on our site.

                    button.accordion-button.collapsed( type='button' data-bs-toggle='collapse' data-bs-target='#collapseFour' aria-expanded='false' aria-controls='collapseFour' ) Is there a recommended price range for the wish items?
                #collapseFour.accordion-collapse.collapse( data-bs-parent='#faq' )
                    .accordion-body We limit wish items to be under $30 each to ensure that all kids get a chance to get their gifts donated.

                    button.accordion-button.collapsed( type='button' data-bs-toggle='collapse' data-bs-target='#collapseFive' aria-expanded='false' aria-controls='collapseFive' ) Why is the child's photo required?
                #collapseFive.accordion-collapse.collapse( data-bs-parent='#faq' )
                    .accordion-body The primary goal of this project is to build personal connections between donors and foster kids, and not just a one-time donation. Our donors are more encouraged to donate to the wish cards with children's photos. They find this personal connection very special. If privacy/confidentiality is a concern, please crop the identifiable features or use photos of them making a heart with their hands, masked faces, their backside, or wearing sunglasses, etc. For alternatives, we suggest using a picture of their art (anything they made or anything that represents them) as well. We have this policy to prevent fraudulent wish submission and to ensure that every kid's wish gets a chance for donation.

                    .accordion-body While we prefer real data, we understand the privacy concerns and you may use a nickname or alias. For the date of birth, if you are unsure or unable to share due to policies, please use your best knowledge. We only care about the birth year to calculate their age for eligibility, so you may make up the month and day if needed.

                    button.accordion-button.collapsed( type='button' data-bs-toggle='collapse' data-bs-target='#collapseSeven' aria-expanded='false' aria-controls='collapseSeven' ) Should let the kids know that if we sign up, they might not receive a gift, correct?
                #collapseSeven.accordion-collapse.collapse( data-bs-parent='#faq' )
                    .accordion-body There is a small chance that some of them might not receive the gift, but we are working very hard to make sure all kids get their wish items by Christmas.

                        p.mb-0 However, only you or your agency staff members can post the wishcards on the kids' behalf due to our security policies.
